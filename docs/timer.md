# Exam Timer Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Exam Timer feature is a new addition to our suite of educational tools, designed to help students effectively manage their time during exams. This feature allows users to set up a timer for their exam duration, providing both visual and auditory cues to keep track of time without distraction.

## Integration

To integrate the Exam Timer feature into your application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of our software.
2. Navigate to `starterkits/saas/src/app/(app)/timer/` to find the main component and related files.
3. Include the Exam Timer component in your application's module where you want the timer to appear.

## Extending the Feature

The Exam Timer is built to be flexible and can be extended to suit various needs. Here are some ideas for extending the feature:

- Customizing the timer's appearance to match your application's theme.
- Adding support for different time formats, such as counting down or up.
- Integrating with study tools to automatically set timers for study sessions or breaks.

## Future Developments

We plan to continuously improve the Exam Timer feature based on user feedback. Some potential future developments include:

- Adding the ability to save and load preset timers for different exam types.
- Implementing notifications or alarms for upcoming time limits.
- Creating a mobile version of the timer for on-the-go study sessions.
